        <p>Welcome! Bem-Vindo!</p>
        <p>The hand has become <i>increasingly less present</i> in the web as we know it today. Most <a target="_blank" href="https://ew.com/">websites</a> today are built from templates on website-building platforms, and the knowledge of how to make a website from scratch is relegated to a select few. It has only grown easier to learn how to make websites, but the perceived requirements and expectations for a website have become so <em>convoluted and arcane</em> that many avoid the subject. 
        <br>  
        <br>    
        This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize <i><b>the hand-quality</b></i> of websites by developing an understanding of  <strong>the best</strong> practices, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p>
